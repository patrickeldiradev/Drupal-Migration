Needed Drupal 6 modules:
- date
- calendar (probably optional)

Needed Drupal 7 modules:
- migrate
- migrate_d2d

Possible module conversions:
- SWFUpload -> jQuery File Upload (https://drupal.org/project/jquery_file_upload)

Problems:
- When Date Popup is used, related field does not updated with correct data from the database
- After deleting some content types, SQL query changes and Drush module should be updated to fit these changes.
